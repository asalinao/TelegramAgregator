## How to use the bot
To use, add channels or chats you are interested in by sending links to the bot. Works for both public and private channels, for channels with join request you need to wait for the approval of the request.

To remove a channel from the bot just click on the “Remove channel” button and select the channel you want to remove.

From now on, you will receive all messages from these chats or channels. Under each message there are two buttons, the first one contains a link to the original message, the second one is needed for translation (only in Russian).

Sometimes errors may occur when parsing or sending messages. In this case, the bot will send a message with an error and a link to the message that caused the error

## Word cloud generation
The bot extracts keywords from each received message using a model trained on real marked-up messages and builds a word cloud based on them. With the help of the cloud you can track the main topics and trends in your infofield
